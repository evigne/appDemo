If the `${username}` placeholder specifically occurs within environmental values in your YAML structure, you can target just those parts of the YAML file for replacement. Assuming that environmental variables are formatted similarly to the example you provided, you can modify the script to focus on replacing placeholders in the `environment` section of the YAML structure.

Here's a refined version of the Python script to specifically handle the environment values:

```python
import yaml

def update_environment_values(data, placeholder, replacement):
    if isinstance(data, dict):
        for key, value in data.items():
            if key == 'environment' and isinstance(value, list):
                # Process each environment variable
                for i, env_var in enumerate(value):
                    for env_key, env_value in env_var.items():
                        if placeholder in env_value:
                            data[key][i][env_key] = env_value.replace(placeholder, replacement)
            else:
                data[key] = update_environment_values(value, placeholder, replacement)
    elif isinstance(data, list):
        for i, item in enumerate(data):
            data[i] = update_environment_values(item, placeholder, replacement)
    return data

def update_yaml(file_path, placeholder, replacement):
    # Load the YAML file
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        content = yaml.safe_load(file)

    # Update environment values
    updated_content = update_environment_values(content, placeholder, replacement)

    # Save the updated YAML back to the file
    with open(file_path, 'w') as file:
        yaml.safe_dump(updated_content, file, default_flow_style=False)

# Usage
yaml_file_path = 'path/to/your/file.yaml'
placeholder = '{USERNAME}'  # Adjust this to match the exact placeholder pattern
new_username = 'myUsername'
update_yaml(yaml_file_path, placeholder, new_username)
```

**Detailed Explanation:**
- The `update_environment_values` function traverses the YAML structure looking specifically for keys named `environment`.
- When it finds an `environment` key, it expects its value to be a list where each element is a dictionary representing an environment variable.
- It then checks each environment variable to see if the value contains the placeholder. If it does, the placeholder is replaced with the new username.
- The outer function `update_yaml` handles reading from and writing back to the YAML file.

This approach ensures that only the placeholders within the environmental values are replaced, respecting the structure you've described. Make sure to adjust the `placeholder` variable if the actual placeholder text in your file differs from `{USERNAME}`.
