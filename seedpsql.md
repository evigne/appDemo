If your SQL file contains multiple `COPY ... FROM STDIN` commands for different tables and you need to seed all of them using Python, you'll need to handle each `COPY` command separately, feeding the appropriate data for each table. This can be achieved by modifying the Python script to parse the SQL file, detect each `COPY` command, and then execute it with the correct data.

Here’s a more comprehensive approach using Python to parse the SQL file and execute the `COPY` commands with the associated data blocks:

### Step 1: Prepare Your SQL File
Ensure your SQL file is properly formatted with the `COPY` commands followed by the data for each command, ending with `\.` on a separate line to signify the end of data for that table. For example:

```sql
COPY table1 FROM STDIN;
1,John,Doe
2,Jane,Doe
\.

COPY table2 FROM STDIN;
1,Product1,20
2,Product2,30
\.
```

### Step 2: Write the Python Script
Here’s how you could structure your Python script:

```python
import psycopg2

# Database connection parameters
db_params = {
    'database': 'your_database_name',
    'user': 'your_username',
    'password': 'your_password',
    'host': 'localhost',
    'port': 5734
}

# Path to your SQL file
sql_file_path = 'path_to_your_sql_file.sql'

def execute_copy_commands(cursor, commands):
    for command, data in commands:
        cursor.copy_expert(command, data)

# Connect to the database
conn = psycopg2.connect(**db_params)
conn.autocommit = True

with conn.cursor() as cursor:
    with open(sql_file_path, 'r') as file:
        commands = []
        command = None
        data = []
        for line in file:
            if line.startswith("COPY"):
                if command and data:
                    commands.append((command, "\n".join(data)))
                command = line.strip()
                data = []
            elif line.strip() == r'\.':
                if command and data:
                    commands.append((command, "\n".join(data)))
                command = None
                data = []
            elif command:
                data.append(line.strip())
        
        if commands:
            execute_copy_commands(cursor, commands)

# Close the database connection
conn.close()
```

### Explanation
1. **Read the SQL File**: The script reads through the SQL file line by line.
2. **Detect COPY Commands**: It identifies lines starting with "COPY", indicating the beginning of a new command.
3. **Gather Data**: It collects the subsequent lines as data until it encounters `\.` which marks the end of data for that `COPY` command.
4. **Execute COPY**: Once all commands and their corresponding data are collected, they are executed using `cursor.copy_expert`.

This script ensures that each `COPY` command and its data are processed together. This method works well for files where `COPY` commands and their data blocks are clearly demarcated. Adjust the path and connection parameters as necessary to match your environment.



If you have many tables and many `COPY ... FROM STDIN` commands, you can streamline the process by reading the entire SQL file, modifying the `COPY ... FROM` commands to `COPY ... FROM STDIN`, and then using Python to handle the data input. Here is a way to do this:

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Modify your SQL file**: Ensure your SQL file uses `COPY ... FROM STDIN` instead of `COPY ... FROM '/path/to/file.csv'`.

2. **Create a Python script** to execute the modified SQL commands and provide the required data through `STDIN`.

### Example Python Script

Here's a comprehensive Python script to handle multiple tables and `COPY ... FROM STDIN` commands:

```python
import psycopg2
import os

# Database connection parameters
db_params = {
    'database': 'your_database_name',
    'user': 'your_username',
    'password': 'your_password',
    'host': 'localhost',
    'port': 5734
}

# Path to your SQL file
sql_file_path = 'path_to_your_sql_file.sql'

def execute_sql_file_with_copy(conn, sql_file_path):
    with open(sql_file_path, 'r') as file:
        sql_commands = file.read()

    with conn.cursor() as cursor:
        # Split the SQL file into individual commands
        sql_commands_list = sql_commands.split(';')
        
        for command in sql_commands_list:
            command = command.strip()
            if command.startswith('COPY') and 'FROM STDIN' in command:
                table_name = command.split()[1]
                data_file_path = f'path_to_data/{table_name}.csv'  # Assumes data files are named after tables
                with open(data_file_path, 'r') as data_file:
                    cursor.copy_expert(command, data_file)
            else:
                cursor.execute(command)

# Connect to the database
conn = psycopg2.connect(**db_params)
conn.autocommit = True

try:
    execute_sql_file_with_copy(conn, sql_file_path)
finally:
    conn.close()
```

### Assumptions:
- The SQL file (`sql_file_path`) contains `COPY ... FROM STDIN` commands.
- Data files are located in a directory (`path_to_data`) and named after their corresponding tables, e.g., `table_name.csv`.

### Explanation:
1. **Reading the SQL File**: The script reads the SQL file and splits it into individual commands.
2. **Handling COPY Commands**: For each `COPY ... FROM STDIN` command, it extracts the table name and reads the corresponding data file.
3. **Executing the Commands**: It uses the `copy_expert()` method to execute the `COPY` command with data provided through `STDIN`. Other SQL commands are executed normally.

This approach should handle multiple `COPY ... FROM STDIN` commands efficiently, ensuring all data is correctly loaded into the PostgreSQL database. Make sure your data files are named appropriately and stored in the specified directory.
